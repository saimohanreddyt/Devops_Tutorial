Docker & Virtual Machine they both are virtulization tool.

What is Docker?
---------------
Docker is popular virtualization software that helps its users in developing, deploying, monitoring, and running applications in a Docker Container with all their dependencies.

Docker containers include all dependencies (frameworks, libraries, etc.) to run an application in an efficient and bug-free manner.

Docker Containers have the following benefits: 

    Light-weight
    Applications run in isolation
    Occupies less space
    Easily portable and highly secure
    Short boot-up time



What is a Virtual Machine?
--------------------------
A virtual machine (VM) is a computing environment or software that aids developers to access an operating system via a physical machine.
